            <h3>Synopsis</h4>
            <p>Beastmen living in an oppressed world, owned by humans, attempt to build a utopia for themselves. There is a mystery involving two human girls who find themselves in the center of this animalistic city.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Impression</h4>
            <p>BNA or Brand New Animal is a whimsical world that deals with a not so whimsical problem *cough* racism *cough*. The main characters seem to fall into their own clich√©s however, despite that they are lovable and made us want to root for them, especially the main female protagonist. We appreciate that, although it is predictable, the creators stick with the storyline and resist the temptation to subvert viewers' expectations. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the non-furry audience:</span> we are pleased to inform y'all that though this show does have furryesque characters, the show itself leaves out most of the questionable parts of the furry fandom (Looking at you Beastars).</p>

            <h3>Synopsis</h4>
            <p>Instead of following the lineage of the Joestar family, this series's main protagonist is Kishibe Rohan. He is a secondary character in the 4th arc of the Jojo sequence. He retells his past encounters with paranormal activity.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Impression</h4>
            <p>As usual Araki uses bright unusual colors and unique animation style to lure viewers in. His bizarre world-building leaves us goin DA FU? but where this reaction is usually a deal breaker for other animes is always a positive for the Jojo series. Personally we have always liked Rohan as a character straight from his debut, and the fangirling continues in this show. The downside is that this spin-off does give a somewhat incomplete vibe overall. We will update as or if the show continues.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Verdict</h4>
            <p>YEE if you like Jojo</p>

            <h3>Synopsis</h4>
            <p>A girl with a unique sense of devotion, tries to catch the eye of her school crush. To fulfill her dream she enlists some help from the neighborhood cats.</p>

            <p><img src="/images/boi.png" alt="patience being tested emoji" class="emoji"> *Inhale* <img src="/images/boiletter.png" alt="the word boi in bright red letters" class="emoji"> We got sucked in at first by the ghibli-ish world building and the pretty animation. The beginning was beautiful, there was mystery and the soundtrack made us feel excited for what was to come. Little did we know that it would be a downward spiral from there. <button id="spoilerbtn" style="color: red" onclick="spoilers()">!!!CLICK FOR SPOILER!!!</button><span id="spoiler" class="hide">What bothered us about this movie was the heroine. In the story, the boy takes care of an affectionate stray cat that always shows up at his house. Come to find out that the cat is the female protagonist transformed! Now that would be cool if it wasn't for the stalker-like vibes that this gives off. If the protagonist had been male, then the whole movie would have been categorized as something else (psychological horror, maybe...). It doesn't help that the heroine is a weirdo but not in the endearing way (i.e. L from Death Note or Major Armstrong from FMA). No she's odd in the sense that she doesn't understand that NO means NO and this is shown in her constant harassment of her school crush. *Side Note* Her school crush also has issues cause when he found out everything, he was strangely cool about it. Despite that there were a few good parts like the cats.</span> We had to force ourselves to finish but if the politics of ethics aint your thing then this might be for you.</p>
